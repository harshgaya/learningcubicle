  <h4>About Us</h4>
  <p>This is all about an <strong>"Idea"</strong><br>An idea which suggest that young
    leading faculties from different institutions to come together to school and to start
    a new culture of education.This is an idea to not allow a student for physical or mental sufferings.
    This is an idea to bring a competitive quality in a very superior form top leading institutions
    to the door steps of every city.We are a team of faculties from top leading institutions for JEE and NEET <p/>
